Member or non-member operators
_______________________________
Always member functions: =(assignment), [](subscription), ->(member access), 
()(function call)

Always friend fucntions: <<(outstream), >>(instream)

All other operators can be either member or non-members.
RULE OF THUMB:
1. if it is a unary operator -> it is a member function
2. if a binary operator treats both operands equally(it leaves them unchanged)
   -> it is a non-member function.
3. if a binary operator doesn't treat both operands equally(left operand usually
   changes) -> make member function of left operands type.

There are of course exceptions to this rule.
