Classes is a feature of object oriented programming.

A class is a way to group data and functionality together.

construction:
class NAME
{
   ....
};

___________________________________________________
Class VS struct:
There is basically no difference between classes and structs. Theres is one small
difference that has to do with visibility: a class is private by default, while
a struct is public by default.

structs basically exists to be backwards compatible with c.
