(a) Give a reason for why the language needs the virtual keyword from a viewpoint of [1p]
the zero overhead principle?

Answer:
Zero overhead principle: what you don't use, you don't pay for.

The virtual keyword tells the compiler the function can be used in a polymorphic context.
Polymorhism involves dynamic dispatch during runtime, even if the function isn't overloaded.
If this was default behaviour for all classes an overhead would be added in all programs -
even if your class doesn't use poymorhism. This would break the zero overhead principle.

A virtual function comes with some overhead compared to non virtual functions. 

dynamic dispatch = process of selecting hich implementation of a polymorhic operation to
call at runtime.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) The <functional> header has a lot of function objects that implement simple oper- [1p]
ations such as std::less implementing operator<. Why do we need these function
objects?

Answer:
Mainly to be used as template arguments since it's easier to work with types in template 
parameters.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Exceptions should be caught by reference. Give two reasons why.

Answer:
Catching exceptions by value can be a problem when faced with inheritance hierarchies.
Having ExceptionA inherit from ExceptionB and overriding items (like an error code) causes
a problem: If an ExceptionA is thrown, the catch block will convert it into a ExceptionB
which causes the error code to change

1) Memory overhead - bad with unnecessary copies
2) Slicing, catching with reference opens up for polymorphism.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) Suppose that we have a class C with an int member i with a constructor that initializes [1p]
i with an int value (see below). A problem with this implementation is that we are
also able to call this constructor with values that are convertible to int. Give the
declarations needed in the class to give compilation errors when the constructor is
called with values of type that is convertible to int (i.e. double, long, bool, char etc.).

class C
{
	int i;
	public:
	C( int v ) : i{v} {}
};

Answer: This can be solved using templates. By defining a template constructor and then marking
it with delete, we remove all constructors except the int one that is defined by itself:

class C
{
	int i;
	public:
	C( int v ) : i{v} {}
	template <typename T>
	C(T) = delete; //Remove all of template type
};

If the constructor is called with int, the standard constructor is called. Any other type 
will be deleted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(e) What is the difference between the noexcept operator and the noexcept specifier?

The noexcept specifier states that a function will not throw any exceptions.
Can be written like:
	void fun() noexcept;
	void fun() noexcept(true);
	void fun() noexcept(false); //May throw

The noexcept operator is executed at compile time and takes tge argument expression without
executing it. It returns either true or false, depending on if the compiler can find something
in the expression that could throw an exception. The noexcept operator can be used to check
if a an expression is noexcept or not.

 template <typename T>
    void swap(T & a, T & b) 
                            noexcept(  // noexcept specifier
                                noexcept(  // noexcept operator
                                    std::is_noexcept_move_constructable_v<T> &&
                                    std::is_noexcept_move_assignable_v<T>
                                )
                            );

1. What does it mean that a type is contextually convertible to bool?

Answer:
It means that implicit conversion is allowed even if the type is marked as explicit.

A type that is contextually convertible to bool can be used as a boolean expression, for
example in an if-statement. To make my own convertible type, a type converting operator
must be implemented. 
bool is a special case in that even if the operator is marked explicit, the compiler can 
call it in a situation that requires a type that is contextually convertible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. A function-try-block is sometimes good when defining constructors. Why are they 
especially good in that use-case?

Answer:
It is a good way to catch a possible error, should the object not be able to be created
properly(ex. failure to initialize a data member). This prevents more errors and eventual 
crashes in the future run time of the program.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. In a template parameter type declaration, you can use typename or class. Does it matter
which one you use?

Answer:
No, it doesn't matter which one you use, they are contextually the same (c++17). Some programmers
may prefer to use typename as using class implies it is a class, which isn't always the case.

Bfore c++17 there was one case you were required to use class(with template template parameters)
(template <template <..> class C> as opposed to template <template <..> typename T>)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Why should one avoid to specialize a function template? What is the, often better, alter- [1p]
native?

Answer:
Because of function call overload rules. A template function will never have its arguments
converted by the compiler to match the call. A normal function overload is often better.

// primary template
template <typename T>
void fun(T t) { ... }

// specialization for int, will not be called with types
// convertible to int such as short and long
template<>
void fun<int>(int t) { ... }

// Normal function will be matched before using a template
void fun(int t) { ... }

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. In which situation would one chose to declare a destructor pure virtual?

You could use a pure virtual destructor in a base class if you want it to be abstract but 
have valid implementations for all other virtual functions (or have no other virtual 
functions). You still have to add an implementation for the destructor:
u

struct A
{
    virtual ~A() = 0;
};
A::~A() = default;

1. Given the following snippet of code, give a reason for having the using declaration on 
line 4 instead of qualifying the call on line 5 (i.e. return std::begin(range)).

template <typename Range >
auto iter(Range && range)
{
    using std::begin;
    return begin(range);
}

Answer:
A using declaration is used to support ADL. If we have a qualified call here, we would 
force the compiler to look in std for all possible functions. The problem is that a 
user-defined type not in the std will of course not have it's begin function in that 
namespace. The question you might ask yourself now is why that declaration is needed at 
all, won't ADL take care of calling the correct function anyways? Well most of the time, 
yes, the problem is the c-style arrays. They are part of the language and not in the std 
but there is an overload of begin in the library. The using-declaration gives us access 
to that function.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Given the following primary template declaration, give a declaration of a specialization 
of foo for type char.

template <typename T>
struct foo;

Answer:
template<>
struct foo<char>;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Assuming v is a std::vector<int>, why is the following code wrong?

static_assert(v.size() > 0, "vector is empty!");

Answer:
static_assert requires a compile time expression as its first argument. This will not work
as vector::size is runtime.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Assume you have definitions for the following functions:

void fun(int, short);
void fun(int, double);

The call fun(2,3) will give an ambiguous overload. Why?

Answer:
either way, an implicit conversion must be done to the 3, either to a short int(?) or a 
double.

An int can be implicitly converted to both double and short and both will give possible 
loss of precision.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Describe what length below does and give a valid example of a call to length.

template <typename ...Args>
int length(Args && ... args)
{
    return sizeof...(args);
}

Answer:
Length returns the number of arguments sent to the function

1. The standard library has a function std::addressof that is used in generic code to find
the address of an object. Usually, the operator & is used for finding addresses of 
objects, why do you think they added a function as well?

Answer:
In order to differentiate between addresses and refererences

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. A forwarding reference and an r-value reference are declared in the same way (Type &&),
but are semantically very different. Why?

ANswer:
A forwarding reference is a template parameter defined as T&& such as 
template <typename T>
void foo(T && ref)
{

}
A forwarding reference will work with any type having any expression categorization due to
reference collapsing. An r-value reference will only bind to temporaries (r-values).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. C++14 added generic lambdas. Give an example of a generic lambda and give a definition
of a function object class that is equivalent to the compiler-generated closure object 
created by your lambda.

Answer:
A lambda generates an anonymous closure object according to example below:
auto l = [](int a){return 2;};

struct __NAME
{
    auto operator()(int a) const { return 2; };
};

A GENERIC lambda is a lambda that takes at least one parameter of type auto which will generate 
a templated operator():

auto gl = [](auto p) { return 2; };

struct __NAME
{
    template <typename T>
    auto operator()(T p) const { return 2; }
};

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Why shouldn¡¦t you use operator< when comparing iterators in the code below (container
is some sort of STL container):
for ( auto it = begin(container); it < end(container); ++it )
// do something with it

Answer:
Only random-access iterators support comparison with operator<. This will not compile with
containers that doesn't support random-access. Instead operator!= should be used.

1. Consider the following function. Why is this interface a bad design? (hint, think about
ownership...)
X* compute(/* some args */)
{
X* res = new X{};
// do something with res
return res;
}

Answer:
By returning a raw pointer, we will leave it up to the user of our function to deallocate the resource.
The problem here is of course that a raw pointer could also point to some static memory that cannot be
deallocated.
