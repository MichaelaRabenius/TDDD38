Keyword: mutable.

*indicates that something can be changed (as opposed to const). Kinda const, but can be changed.

If we have a const function, we are not able to change any internal private variable from with in that
function (they remain constant). However, if we for some reason need to be able to change a variable
from within this const function, we can declare it mutable, which allows the variable to be changed.
-> we allow constant functions to change the variable!

The other use: (with lambdas)
Note: a lambda expression is basically a quick small function we can assign to a variable on the fly.

By declaring the lambda expression as mutable, variables passed by value to the lambda can be changed.
